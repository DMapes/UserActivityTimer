# UserActivityTimer
Calculates time using mouse or keyboard. I use this to get work time each day. It has been helpfull since I have been working from home.
This script will add a new folder on the users Desktop. This folder will contain daily login time .csv file. 
The file will be updated each time the script logs a new activity time. Chahge the delay variable for extended delay time. Delay is in seconds.
Future versions will log to a .log file for each day and have the ability to read a weekly and monthly total.
